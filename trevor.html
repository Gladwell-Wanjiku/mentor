    <p>Born A Crime
        Born a Crime is about Trevor Noah’s childhood in apartheid. A child of mixed heritage, Noah details the challenges he faced when growing up.
        <br>
        In the first chapter, he focuses on the role of religion in his childhood. Every Sunday, his mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, takes him and his baby brother,
        <br>
        to three churches: an integrated megachurch that seeks “to make Jesus cool,” an austere white church whose pastor focuses on interpreting passages from the Bible, 
        <br>
        and an informal outdoor black church whose congregants spend hours praying for Jesus to alleviate their suffering. He shows how Christianity offers his mother
        <br>
         a source of moral strength and discipline, which she seeks to pass onto her children. 
         <br>        
        Noah explains how he came into being: his mother’s fearlessness was a lifelong pattern, and she insisted on becoming a secretary and illegally living in a white neighbourhood.
        <br>        
        The country implemented apartheid, a system of racial segregation, from 1948 until 1991. Its origins may be traced to 1652, when Dutch settlers came on the Cape of Good Hope 
        <br>
        and enslaved the local indigenous population. Afrikaners, the Dutch settlers who came under British rule in the middle of the 1800s, went inland and created their own distinct culture.
        <br>        
        A legal ruling declared interracial sex to be prohibited. Offenders faced a maximum sentence of five years in prison for men and up to four years for women. In reality, though, 
        <br>
        Black males who had intimacy with White women were frequently accused of rape. The crime was so significant to the government that it assigned special police teams to spy through windows 
        <br>
        where illicit activities might be taking place.
        <br>        
        This is the world that Noah was born into on February 20, 1984. His father was Caucasian, while his mother was Black. Both of them had risked going to jail by getting pregnant.
        <br> 
        Noah was the real deal—proof of a crime.
